# Hyprland Config

This repository contains my personal **[Hyprland](https://hypr.land/)** configuration files and related scripts.  
All paths and setups assume the config lives in the `~` (home) directory.

## Structure

- `.config/hypr/` – Main Hyprland configuration files.
- `scripts/` – Utility scripts for workspace management, launching editors, etc.

## Features

- Automatic workspace setup and project editor launching.
- Preconfigured layouts, keybindings, and window rules.
- Scripts are designed to work relative to the home directory (`~`).

## Installation

Clone this repository to your home directory and run install script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SzymCode/hyprland-config ~/temp-hyprland-config
sudo chmod +x ~/temp-hyprland-config/install.sh
~/temp-hyprland-config/install.sh
```
